<p><strong>parallelize(list, body)</strong></p>

<p>Execute tasks parallel. First argument are the parameters passed each time to the closure, which is the second argument</p>
<pre>
  <b>list</b>: parameters that are passed each time to closure

  Usage example to trigger list of jobs in parallel
  parallelize(jobs) { String jobName ->
                Map jobParameters = [number: dynamicEnvironment.find("\\d+"), type: "${env.type}", artifactVersion: artifactVersion]
                triggerJob(jobName, true, jobParameters)
